# libGDX Wiki
This is a first draft of porting the libGDX Wiki to a Jekyll blog. It can be seen live at: https://crykn.github.io/

## How does it work?
- The wiki files were ported to Jekyll with a modified version of [Spaio's](https://github.com/Spaio/libgdx-wiki-on-pages) `WikiToPagesTranslator.java`, which can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/crykn/e58577f4290026247add420a43ab1cfe); for additional instructions, take a look at the comments at the top of the file
- The website itself is a Jekyll blog that is deployed to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions; see `.github/workflows/github-pages.yml`
- The blog uses a modified version of the [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) theme; see `_sass/wiki.scss`; `_layouts/default_wiki.html`, `_layouts/wiki.html`

## ToDo
- [ ] **Improve sidebar layout & responsiveness**; the corresponding CSS stuff should be located in `_sass/wiki.scss`
- [ ] **Embed GWT content**; the JS code should be located somewhere in `/assets/wiki`; then a `<div>` and the corresponding script (see the index.html generated by GWT) needs to be added to the wiki page; the GWT application itself requires some (asset) path changes. Later on, a custom `embed-gwt` element (see [here](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx.github.io/blob/dev/_includes/status.html) for a very basic example of an element) should be created to simplify usage.
- [ ] **Fix dark mode**; i.e. add a dark style to `_sass/wiki.scss`, utilising `prefers-color-scheme: dark` media queries
