In [Status Report #2](/news/2020/09/devlog_2_release_schedule) we announced our commitment to increase the frequency of releases for libGDX. Our intention was – and is – to provide more stability and reliability for you, the developers, as well as to enable you to start integrating our improvements and new features much quicker into your applications. After a brief adjustment period, we are now on track to release monthly versions of libGDX.

1.9.14 is a **maintenance release**, mainly containing minor changes and improvements. Among those are a few (small) **breaking changes**, so please take note if you are updating your existing applications:

- [Core] `AnimationDesc#update` now returns `-1` (instead of `0`) if an animation is not finished ([#6303](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/6303))
- [Core] `InputEventQueue` no longer implements `InputProcessor`; to preserve old behaviour pass an `InputProcessor` to `#drain`. ([#6357](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/6357))
- [Headless] `HeadlessApplicationConfiguration#renderInterval` was changed to `#updatesPerSecond`; so, for example, `16.6F` should become `60` ([#6306](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/6306))
- [iOS]`IOSUIViewController` has been moved to its own separate class ([#6336](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/6336))

**Known issues:** At the moment, there are some issues with [Meshes, ModelCaches](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/6390), [`glTexImage2D`](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/6309#discussion_r569000208) (used by framebuffers) and the [RoboVM backend](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/6402) (duplicate symbol errors). This is fixed in [libGDX 1.10.0](/news/2021/04/gdx-1-10).
{: .notice--warning}

Other **notable changes** are:
- There is a new `ScreenUtils#clear` method. This is meant as a simpler version of `Gdx.gl.glClearColor(r, g, b, a);` and `Gdx.gl.glClear(mask);` and allows you to save a whole of 23 characters! Incredible, isn't it?
- Moreover, we introduced a `Graphics#setForegroundFPS()` method to allow (simpler) FPS changes at runtime.
- In addition, the platform-specific `Gdx.files` implementations can now be overridden.
- Please be aware that the gdx-controller releases now use their own versioning scheme. The latest version is `2.1.0`. Find out more in the [migration guide](https://github.com/libgdx/gdx-controllers/wiki/Migrate-from-v1).

Last but not least, we'd also like to thank everybody who tested this release after [code freeze](/news/2021/01/devlog-6-gdx-1-9-14-snapshots)! We are glad for any help!
