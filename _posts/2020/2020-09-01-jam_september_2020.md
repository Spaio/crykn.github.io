We are proud to present the 14th instalment of our regular [libGDX Jam](/community/jams/), which allows all of you to create awesome games using the best framework out there. We encourage camaraderie, teamwork, and good sportsmanship with a side of well-intentioned buffoonery. The general jam rules can as always be found [here](/community/jams/). **To participate take a look at the official [itch.io page of the jam](https://itch.io/jam/libgdx-jam-september-2020).** 

Be sure to get involved with the community by joining the libGDX discord server!

## Schedule
The theme chosen is **PARALLEL WORLDS**. How will you achieve this? Will you make two games execute at the same time in different windows? Will you draw two worlds on the screen next to each other? The choice is yours... Begin the carnage!

- **Theme Submission:** 9/6/20 - 9/12/20. Everyone will be allowed to submit a theme for the jam.
- **Voting:** 9/13/20 - 9/19/20.  Everyone will vote on their favorite theme. May the best win!
- **Jam:** 9/20/20 - 9/26/20. Participants will create their games and rejoice!
