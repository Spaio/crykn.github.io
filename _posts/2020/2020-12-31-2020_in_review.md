2020 was – without a doubt – a special year. For us, not least because we made some very real progress on libGDX! We were able to reverse the trend of the ever-growing issue and PR counts (do you still remember that we had nearly 300 issues at the start of this year?) and were able to resolve quite a few year-old problems. We are very proud of what we achieved and honoured to be part of the libGDX contributors team.

But we would also like to take this opportunity to thank you all for your ongoing support! Without all of you that are part of our ever so growing Discord community this wouldn’t have been possible. We are excited for what is to come and wish you all a happy new year!
