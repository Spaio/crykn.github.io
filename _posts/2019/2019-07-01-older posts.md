If you're looking for the old blog posts, don't worry, they are still available via the [Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20201109040808/http://www.badlogicgames.com/wordpress/). The old [forum](https://web.archive.org/web/20201028185002/https://www.badlogicgames.com/forum/) can be found there as well.
