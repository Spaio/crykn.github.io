Please note that the issue tracker isn't for personal assistance. If you have a problem that isn't a reproducible bug in the core framework, please ask on our [Discord](/community/discord/) server instead.
{: .notice--info}

Before you report an issue on our [issue tracker](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues), we ask you to do a few things:
- Verify that the problem hasn't already been reported on the tracker.
- Make sure the bug hasn't already been fixed. Use the latest snapshot of libGDX to try to reproduce your issue.
- Create a concise, self-contained example to demonstrate the issue. If we can't reproduce your issue, we can't fix it.

Once you have done this, please submit this along with any stacktraces or needed assets to the issue tracker, whilst filling out the template that is shown when [creating a new issue](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/new).
